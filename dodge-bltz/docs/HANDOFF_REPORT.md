# Dodge BLTZ Developer Handoff Report

**Project**: Dodge BLTZ Beta MVP  
**Date**: Generated by AI Assistant  
**Target**: WAX Blockchain Testnet  
**Status**: Ready for Development and Testing  

## Executive Summary

This handoff report provides a comprehensive overview of the Dodge BLTZ Beta MVP implementation. The project consists of two modular EOSIO C++ smart contracts and a Unity client application that creates a provably-fair, RNG-based dodgeball mini-game on the WAX blockchain.

## Project Architecture

### Smart Contracts (EOSIO C++)

#### 1. DBP Token Contract (`dbp_token.cpp`)
- **Purpose**: Manages $DBP token issuance and transfers
- **Features**: 
  - Standard EOSIO token functionality
  - Restricted minting (only gameplay contract can issue)
  - Maximum supply: 1,000,000 DBP tokens
  - Precision: 4 decimal places (0.0001 DBP minimum)

#### 2. Gameplay Contract (`gameplay.cpp`)
- **Purpose**: Handles BLTZ actions and RNG integration
- **Features**:
  - Nonce-based replay protection
  - WAX RNG Oracle integration
  - 35% success rate for BLTZ actions
  - Automatic token rewards on success
  - Deferred RNG request/callback pattern

### Unity Client (C#)

#### Core Scripts
1. **WalletConnection.cs**: WAX Cloud Wallet integration
2. **GameplayManager.cs**: Smart contract interaction and game logic
3. **UIManager.cs**: Three-screen UI state management

#### UI Design
- **Start Screen**: Wallet connection and game status
- **Resolving Screen**: Transaction processing with loading animation
- **Result Screen**: Success/failure display with updated balance

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Details

#### DBP Token Contract Features
```cpp
// Key Actions
ACTION create(const name& issuer, const asset& maximum_supply);
ACTION issue(const name& to, const asset& quantity, const std::string& memo);
ACTION transfer(const name& from, const name& to, const asset& quantity, const std::string& memo);

// Security Features
- Restricted minting to gameplay contract only
- Standard EOSIO token validation
- Balance and supply management
```

#### Gameplay Contract Features
```cpp
// Key Actions
ACTION play(const name& player, const uint64_t& nonce);
ACTION receiverand(const uint64_t& caller_signing_value, 
                   const checksum256& caller_signing_value_hash,
                   const uint64_t& random_value);
ACTION init(const name& token_contract);

// Core Logic
- 35% success rate (random_value % 100 < 35)
- 1.0000 DBP reward per successful play
- Nonce cleanup (24-hour expiration)
- WAX RNG Oracle integration (orng.wax)
```

### Unity Client Architecture

#### WAX Integration
- WAX Cloud Wallet authentication
- Transaction signing and submission
- Real-time balance querying
- Contract state monitoring

#### Game Flow
1. **Connect Wallet**: User authenticates with WAX Cloud Wallet
2. **Generate Nonce**: Client creates unique replay-protection nonce
3. **Submit Transaction**: Play action sent to blockchain
4. **Monitor Result**: Client polls for RNG Oracle response
5. **Display Outcome**: Success/failure shown with updated balance

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- EOSIO CDT (WAX edition) for contract compilation
- Unity 2022 LTS for client development
- cleos CLI tool for blockchain interaction
- WAX testnet accounts (dbptoken.acc, gameplay.acc)

### Build Process
```bash
# Compile contracts
cd dodge-bltz
./scripts/build.sh

# Deploy to testnet
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Initialize contracts
./scripts/init.sh
```

### Testing Framework
- Unit test scaffolds provided for both contracts
- Tests cover token issuance, nonce protection, RNG logic
- Integration tests for full game flow

## Security Considerations

### Contract Security
- **Nonce Protection**: Prevents replay attacks
- **Permission Management**: Restricted minting access
- **Input Validation**: All parameters validated
- **Oracle Authentication**: Only WAX RNG Oracle can provide randomness

### Operational Security
- Private key management for testnet accounts
- Proper permission configuration for cross-contract calls
- Resource management (RAM, CPU, NET) for contract operations

## Game Economics

### Token Economics
- **Symbol**: DBP (4 decimal precision)
- **Reward**: 1.0000 DBP per successful play
- **Success Rate**: 35% (provably fair via RNG Oracle)
- **Max Supply**: 1,000,000.0000 DBP
- **Distribution**: Earned through gameplay only (no airdrops)

### Player Experience
- **Entry Cost**: Free (no entry fee for Beta)
- **Potential Reward**: 1 DBP token (35% chance)
- **Failure Outcome**: No penalty, no reward
- **Replay Protection**: Unique nonce required per play
