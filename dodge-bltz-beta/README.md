# Dodge BLTZ Beta - Unified Integration

**A provably-fair, RNG-based dodgeball mini-game on the WAX blockchain**

> ðŸ”— *This is the unified integration of work from multiple development sub-agents (Opus, Sonnet, and O3) for the Dodge-BLTZ Beta MVP.*

## Overview

Dodge BLTZ is a blockchain-based game where players attempt to dodge incoming balls with a 35% success chance. Each successful play mints one $DBP token. The game uses WAX Cloud Wallet for authentication and the official WAX RNG Oracle to guarantee fairness.

This Beta MVP focuses on a single "BLTZ" action with three-screen UI (Start, Resolving, Result). Features like FlexBLTZ, CP currency, NFTs, leaderboards, and governance are planned for future phases.

## Integration Summary

This unified project combines:
- **Core EOSIO/WAX contracts** with RNG Oracle integration
- **Unity client** with WAX Cloud Wallet support  
- **Comprehensive documentation** and deployment guides
- **Testing infrastructure** for contract validation
- **Build and deployment scripts** for WAX testnet

## Key Components

### Smart Contracts

1. **dbp_token.cpp** - Manages $DBP token issuance and transfers
2. **gameplay.cpp** - Handles play action, nonce-based replay protection, and RNG integration

### Unity Client

- **WalletConnection.cs** - WAX Cloud Wallet integration with session management
- **GameplayManager.cs** - Game logic, transaction submission, and result handling
- **GameConfig.cs** - Centralized configuration for contract accounts and settings
- Three-screen UI flow: Start â†’ Resolving â†’ Result

### Beta MVP Scope

- âœ… Single BLTZ action with 35% success rate
- âœ… $DBP token rewards (1 token per successful play)
- âœ… WAX Cloud Wallet authentication
- âœ… WAX RNG Oracle for provably fair randomness
- âœ… Nonce-based replay protection
- âœ… Three-screen Unity UI

## Prerequisites

- EOSIO CDT (WAX edition)
- Unity 2022 LTS or newer
- WAX testnet accounts for `dbptoken.acc` and `gameplay.acc`
- Node.js and npm
- cleos (EOSIO CLI)

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dodge-bltz-beta
   ```

2. **Compile Contracts**
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ./build_contracts.sh
   ```

3. **Deploy to WAX Testnet**
   ```bash
   ./deploy_contracts.sh
   ```

4. **Configure Unity Client**
   - Open Unity 2022 LTS
   - Load the unity-client project
   - Update contract account names in GameConfig.cs
   - Build and test

## Documentation

- [Quick Start Guide](QUICKSTART.md) - Fast setup for developers
- [Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) - Step-by-step deployment instructions

```

## Sub-Agent Integration Notes

This project successfully unifies contributions from:
- **Opus**: Core contract architecture and RNG integration design
- **Sonnet**: Unity client implementation and WAX wallet integration
- **O3**: Testing infrastructure and deployment automation

All redundancies have been removed and naming conventions unified for consistency.
